# Ansible Lookup plugin : Github organization members

This small project is an [Ansible](TODO link) [lookup plugin](TODO link) that
fetches [Github](TODO link) organization members.

Why would you want that? Mainly when using a Github organization as a 
poor-man users directory. With this plugin, you could for example manage 
system users on a server based on the Github organization members.
